# 📝 LSTM Word Completion  

This project implements a **word-level LSTM model** for **sentence completion**. The model is trained on **Shakespeare's plays dataset** to predict the next word in a sequence. A user-friendly interface is also provided, where users can input partial sentences, and the model suggests the next word in real time.

## 🚀 **Features**  
✔ Loads and preprocesses **Shakespeare's dataset**  
✔ Tokenizes and **vectorizes text sequences**  
✔ Builds and trains an **LSTM model** for word prediction  
✔ Provides a **real-time interface** for sentence completion  
✔ Evaluates model performance using **loss and accuracy metrics**  
✔ Experiments with **different hyperparameters** (epochs, batch size, learning rate)  
✔ Visualizes **training & validation loss**
